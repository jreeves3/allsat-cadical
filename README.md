Satisfiability Solver printing/counting all satisfying assignments.

General method:

  - Find a satisfying assignment and print.
  - Learn the clause blocking the satifying assignment as an original clause.
  - Backtrack to to level 0 and continue solving.
  - Terminate when formula becomes unsatisfiable.

For n variables unassigned in a given satisfying assignment, 
there are 2^n possible assignments to those variables
each resulting in a valid satisfying assignment.

Use option `--allsat` for printing the assignments.

Use option `--probvars=n` for setting problem variable cutoff.
All variables strictly greater than `probvars` will be removed
from blocking satisfying assignments. If `probvars` is not set,
default is `maxvar`.

Example use:

```bash
> ./build/cadical tour-7-4.cnf --allsat > temp.txt
> grep "^s\|^v\|^n" temp.txt
```

Each satisfying assignment found is printed, along
with the cummulative number of solutions.

CaDiCaL Simplified Satisfiability Solver
===============================================================================

The goal of the development of CaDiCaL was to obtain a CDCL solver,
which is easy to understand and change, while at the same time not being
much slower than other state-of-the-art CDCL solvers.

Originally we wanted to also radically simplify the design and internal data
structures, but that goal was only achieved partially, at least for instance
compared to Lingeling.

However, the code is much better documented and CaDiCaL actually became in
general faster than Lingeling even though it is missing some preprocessors
(mostly parity and cardinality constraint reasoning), which would be crucial
to solve certain instances.

Use `./configure && make` to configure and build `cadical` and the library
`libcadical.a` in the default `build` sub-directory.  The header file of
the library is [`src/cadical.hpp`](src/cadical.hpp) and includes an example
for API usage.
  
See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) for options and more details related to the build
process and [`test/README.md`](test/README.md) for testing the library and
the solver.  Since release 1.5.1 we have a [`NEWS.md`](NEWS.md) file.

The solver has the following usage `cadical [ dimacs [ proof ] ]`.
See `cadical -h` for more options.
